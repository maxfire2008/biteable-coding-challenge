# Biteable coding challenge
To run my code you need python installed and the pip package manager `python.org` [Python 3.9.1 for MacOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/python-3.9.1-macosx10.9.pkg)

To install flask which is the only dependancy run `pip install flask`

You can the run the program with `py -m flask run`

To change the file in use run `export LISTFILE=input1.txt`

You can then access the output at `http://localhost:5000`
